tag the language with <lang> containing attributes xml:lang with the exact same name of the language
	Ensure that the language names in a page have been proof-read and fixed

tag the words with <gloss> containing attributes of xml:lang pointing to the respective language and attribute of target pointing to the xml:id of the German

tag the German with <term> containing attributes xml:id with the exact same name as the term itself
	Ensure that all German terms in a page have been proof-read and fixed

Steps :

1. identify, fix (if any), and tag the language

2. identify, fix (if any), and tag the German

3. identify, fix (if any), which gloss refers to a given German; tag this gloss-word according to the language and the German


# Important!

- Use ̌  (i.e., @ + 1 + 3) not ̆  (***)

- Always fix diacritics with the Keyman input

- pay attention to the use of colon in the xml:lang attributes (ensure we do not use IPA ː)

- use @change attribute to specify the original source form that is changed inside the <gloss> element (e.g., the word "gakw. kodar" 'daughter'/'Tochter' is abbreviated on "gakw." while for 'son/Sohn', it is spelled out as "gakwad")

- use ~ to indicate repduplication in Malay source form

1. search for language

    - S: \b(Malaienl.+?|Singkel|Banjak-Inseln|Nias|Mentawej-Inseln|Engano|Gorontalo|Togean-Inseln|Wammer|Wonumbai|Trangan|Koor|Tijoor|Kei-Inseln|Watubella|Goram|Karufa|Nufoor|Andai|Hattam|Humboldtbai)\b
    - R: <lang xml:lang="\1">\1</lang>

2. search for the term/German:

    - S: page-dependent: \b(...)\b

    - R: <term xml:id="\1">\1</term>

3.1 (alternative 1) search for the form:

    - S: \b(...)\b

    - R: <gloss xml:lang="" target="">\1</gloss> OR

    - R: <gloss xml:lang="" target="" change="">\1</gloss>

    The `change=...` attribute is used to place the original form that is changed and taggedǃ (see e.g., the structure for anak laki-laki ini p. 598).

3.2 (alternative 2: better ?) search for the form (and changing the term/German in the replace field according to the form) and WITH LANGUAGE CONSTANT
