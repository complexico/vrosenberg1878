## Overview

The current work in this repository is XML-tagging the relevant words (with their respective languages and German gloss) in the unstructured OCR output. The tagging is used to processed the OCR into a [tibble/table](https://github.com/complexico/vrosenberg1878/blob/main/data/vrosenberg1878.tsv) (also work-in-progress). The comparative word list includes words from the Enggano language and they are included in the Shiny app of the *[EnoLEX](https://enggano.shinyapps.io/enolex/)* database.
